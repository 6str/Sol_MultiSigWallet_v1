# Sol_MultiSigWallet_v1
a rudimentary multi sig wallet

a basic multi sig wallet implementation that can be quickly written off the top of the head.
much effort was put in to writing uint tests for the wallet code, and forms the basis for writing the next versions with more features.

unit tests written with chai
TestsHelper.sol used for some unit tests and a reentrancy test
