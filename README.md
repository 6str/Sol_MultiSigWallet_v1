# Sol_MultiSigWallet_v1
a rudimentary multi sig wallet<br>

a basic multi sig wallet that can be quickly written off the top of the head.
much more time and effort went into writing the uint tests, which will be a valuable resource for developing subsequent versions.<br>

contracts developed with hardhat<br>
unit tests: chai<br>
other frameworks: coverage, slither<br>

TestsHelper.sol: used to setup a failed transaction unit test, and a reentrancy test.<br>
